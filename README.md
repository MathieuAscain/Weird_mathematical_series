# Weird mathematical series
Final exam from the HDN BTS SIO first year, algorithm course.

A **number** is selected by the user.
The algorithm calculates the **sum** of the *euclidean division rests*, each of them raise to the square, until the *entire euclidean division* of the **number** reaches 0.
If the **sum** is equal to 1 or 4, the programs returns the result which is stored in a list.
If the sum is not equal to 1 or 4, the program will be executed again until reaching 1 or 4 as a final result.
I have done this program using a recursive function.
